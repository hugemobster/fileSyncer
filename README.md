# fileSyncer
My own file syncer to bi-directionally sync files between my laptop (MacOS) and PC (Windows and Arch btw). Due to the various OSes I needed a system that was OS agnostic, so that I could sync from my laptop to PC while using windows or arch 

Currently being prototyped in python and untested, eventually will be ported to something faster maybe rust
